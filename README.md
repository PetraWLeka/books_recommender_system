## Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering provides users with suggestions based on the similarity of content. The primary disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot suggest a product that the user has never encountered before.

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering recommends items to users based on the preferences of similar users. It identifies a subset of users with similar tastes to a given user, analyzes the items they prefer, and generates a list of recommendations ranked by collective preferences.

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-based collaborative filtering segments similar customers based on shared preferences. Recommendations are provided based on these grouped users.

## Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two or more vectors to determine if they point in the same direction. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates identical vectors.
